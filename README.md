1.) Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The requirements and goal of this project was to develop an app that allows a user to log in, create an account, and create, edit, or delete items in an inventory app. The user needs that were addressed was the ability to add or remove items that are stored in the warehouse as well as edit currently held items.

2.) What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The necessary screens included, a login screen, a new user screen, a grid view for the items, and a notification setting. I kept users in mind by trying to keep everything as simple as possible as to not overwhelm the screen and confuse users. The designs were successful as they were simple and easy to use.

3.) How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

The coding process of the application proved to be a bit more challenging then expected. First, I designed the page and then moved on the the Java code. This worked for a little while, but became difficult when it came to individual fragments.

4.) Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I had to innovate the database functions. I needed to populate a list of items to track. I couldn't figure out how to edit items in real time and it was a challenge. 

5.) In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

The UI layout is in my opinion the best component of my app. I tried to keep everything simple as to not confuse the user and I think I pulled it off quite well.
